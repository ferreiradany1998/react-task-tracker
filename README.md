# Task Tracker

This project is a result of me following the [React JS Crash Course 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7ejDZ8SWv8&ab_channel=TraversyMedia) where I learned the following concepts:
- App component & JSX
- Expressions in JSX
- PropTypes
- Styling
- Events
- Mapping & Filtering lists
- useState & useEffect Hook
- Global state
- Icons with react-icons
- Conditional Styling
- Build for Production
- JSON Server
- Fetch tasks from JSON Server
- Delete tasks from JSON Server
- Add tasks to JSON Server
- Routing

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Before launching the app with npm start

Since this application uses JSON Server and it contains the Tasks, we must launch JSON Server before launching npm start.

To launch JSON Server please write on terminal: _npm run server_ 

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start` or `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test` or `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build` or `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject` or `npm eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
